# Sepsafe
Temporal machine learning framework for early sepsis risk prediction based on multivariate ICU time-series data, leveraging a stacked (LSTM) architecture. Beyond retrospective evaluation, the model was deployed within a lightweight mobile application, enabling real-time inference, and visualization of short-term risk trajectories.
